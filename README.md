## Overview 

FACEAPP is a famous app that uses Deep Learning to generate fake pictures of people with different styles of hair, makeup and so on. But in this project we are interested in its gender swap feature which as its name indicates turns images of males into females and vice versa.

## Goal

The goal is to scrap a decent amount of fake and original images, clean the images and train a deep learning model using transfer learning to achieve a good accuracy.
